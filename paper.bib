	abstract = {The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule lies at the heart of the semiclassical theory of a Bloch electron in a magnetic field. This rule is predictive of Landau levels and de Haas–van Alphen oscillations for conventional metals, as well as for a host of topological metals which have emerged in the recent intercourse between band theory, crystalline symmetries, and topology. The essential ingredients in any quantization rule are connection formulas that match the semiclassical (WKB) wave function across regions of strong quantum fluctuations. Here, we propose (a) a multicomponent WKB wave function that describes transport within degenerate-band subspaces, and (b) the requisite connection formulas for saddle points and type-II Dirac points, where tunneling respectively occurs within the same band, and between distinct bands. (a) and (b) extend previous works by incorporating phase corrections that are subleading in powers of the field; these corrections include the geometric Berry phase, and account for the orbital magnetic moment and the Zeeman coupling. A comprehensive symmetry analysis is performed for such phase corrections occurring in closed orbits, which is applicable to solids in any (magnetic) space group. We have further formulated a graph-theoretic description of semiclassical orbits. This allows us to systematize the construction of quantization rules for a large class of closed orbits (with or without tunneling), as well as to formulate the notion of a topological invariant in semiclassical magnetotransport—as a quantity that is invariant under continuous deformations of the graph. Landau levels in the presence of tunneling are generically quasirandom, i.e., disordered on the scale of nearest-neighbor level spacings but having longer-ranged correlations; we develop a perturbative theory to determine Landau levels in such quasirandom spectra.},

    Note = {$l^2S\gg 1$ is assured by requiring $\epsilon_0>0.4$; the reason of choosing $\epsilon_0<1.0$ is Dirac point lying at high energy requires too much harmonics in numerical diagonalization. This requirement is equivalent to $\sqrt{0.8m}\alpha/\hbar<Z<\sqrt{2m}\alpha/\hbar$, corresponding to the boundaries of the plots in (d).}

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

These two notions are encoded in the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition as a phase (λ) that is subleading in powers of the field; λ is measurable in the phase offset of the de Haas–van Alphen oscillation, as well as of fixed-bias oscillations of the differential conductance in tunneling spectroscopy. In some solids and for certain field orientations, λ/π are robustly integer valued, owing to the symmetry of the extremal orbit; i.e., they are the topological invariants of magnetotransport. Our comprehensive symmetry analysis identifies solids in any (magnetic) space group for which λ is a topological invariant, as well as the symmetry-enforced degeneracy of Landau levels. The analysis is simplified by our formulation of ten (and only ten) symmetry classes for closed, Fermi-surface orbits. Case studies are discussed for graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, 3D Weyl and Dirac metals, and crystalline and Z2 topological insulators. In particular, we point out that a π phase offset in the fundamental oscillation should not be viewed as a smoking gun for a 3D Dirac metal.},

Tunneling between the electron and hole pockets in a magnetic field is the momentum space counterpart of Klein tunneling at a p−n junction in real space.

In addition to the trivial, gapped phase that is expected, we find that band inversion leads to a class of topological, gapless phases. These topological phases are exemplified by the monolayers of MTe2 (M=W,Mo) if spin-orbit coupling is neglected. We characterize the Dirac band touching of these topological metals by the Wilson loop of the non-Abelian Berry gauge field. Furthermore, we develop a criterion for the proximity of these topological metals to 2D and 3D Z2 topological insulators when spin-orbit coupling is included; our criterion is based on nonsymmorphic symmetry eigenvalues, and may be used to identify topological materials without inversion symmetry. An additional feature of the Dirac cone in monolayer MTe2 is that it tilts over in a Lifshitz transition to produce electron and hole pockets—a type-II Dirac cone. These pockets, together with the pseudospin structure of the Dirac electrons, suggest a unified, topological explanation for the recently reported, nonsaturating magnetoresistance in WTe2, as well as its circular dichroism in photoemission. We complement our analysis and first-principles band structure calculations with an ab-initio-derived tight-binding model for the WTe2 monolayer.},

Majorana and Weyl fermions had not been observed experimentally until the recent discovery of condensed matter systems such as topological superconductors and semimetals, in which they arise as low-energy excitations. Here we propose the existence of a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion that emerges at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter. This particle was missed by Weyl because it breaks the stringent Lorentz symmetry in high-energy physics. Lorentz invariance, however, is not present in condensed matter physics, and by generalizing the Dirac equation, we find the new type of Weyl fermion. In particular, whereas Weyl semimetals—materials hosting Weyl fermions—were previously thought to have standard Weyl points with a point-like Fermi surface (which we refer to as type-I), we discover a type-II Weyl point, which is still a protected crossing, but appears at the contact of electron and hole pockets in type-II Weyl semimetals. We predict that WTe2 is an example of a topological semimetal hosting the new particle as a low-energy excitation around such a type-II Weyl point. The existence of type-II Weyl points in WTe2 means that many of its physical properties are very different to those of standard Weyl semimetals with point-like Fermi surfaces.},

Such a perspective is further reinterpreted as a quantization of the semiclassical electron density in solids. Our theory not only reproduces Onsager’s rule at zeroth order and the Berry phase and magnetic moment correction at first order but also explains the nature of higher-order corrections in a universal way. In applications, those higher-order corrections are expected to curve the linear relation between the level index and the inverse of the magnetic field, as already observed in experiments. Our theory then provides a way to extract the correct value of Berry phase as well as the magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature from Landau level fan diagrams in experiments. Moreover, it can be used theoretically to calculate Landau levels up to second-order accuracy for realistic models.},

These ‘hourglass’ fermions are formed in the large-gap insulators, KHgX (X = As, Sb, Bi), which we propose as the first material class whose band topology relies on non-symmorphic symmetries. Besides the hourglass fermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a three-dimensional generalization of the quantum spin Hall effect, which has previously been observed only in two-dimensional crystals. To describe the bulk topology of non-symmorphic crystals, we propose a non-Abelian generalization of the geometric theory of polarization. Our non-trivial topology originates from an inversion of the rotational quantum numbers, which we propose as a criterion in the search for topological materials.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of topological insulators and semimetals, there has been much research into predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of these materials, in which the topology of electronic states leads to robust surface states and electromagnetic responses. This apparent success, however, masks a fundamental shortcoming: topological insulators represent only a few hundred of the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds in material databases. However, it is unclear whether this low number is indicative of the esoteric nature of topological insulators or of a fundamental problem with the current approaches to finding them. Here we propose a complete electronic band theory, which builds on the conventional band theory of electrons, highlighting the link between the topology and local chemical bonding. This theory of topological quantum chemistry provides a description of the universal (across materials), global properties of all possible band structures and (weakly correlated) materials, consisting of a graph-theoretic description of momentum (reciprocal) space and a complementary group-theoretic description in real space. For all 230 crystal symmetry groups, we classify the possible band structures that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically non-trivial. Our electronic band theory sheds new light on known topological insulators, and can be used to predict many more.},

We consider the two-band case carefully in view of spintronics applications, where transitions between spin-split bands often occur even for relatively weak electromagnetic fields. We demonstrate that much of the semiclassical formalism developed for the single-band case can be generalized to multiple bands, and examine the nontrivial non-Abelian corrections arising from the additional degree of freedom. Along with the center of mass motion in crystal momentum and real space, one must also take into account the probability amplitudes to characterize the dynamics between the bands. We derive the wave packet energy up to the first order gradient correction and obtain the equations of motion for the real- and k-space center of the wave packet, as well as for the probability amplitudes. These equations include the non-Abelian Berry curvature terms and a non-Abelian correction to the group velocity. As an example, we apply our formalism to describe coherent wave packet evolution under the action of an electric field, demonstrating that it leads to electrical separation of spins. A sizable separation will be observed, with a large degree of tunability, making this mechanism a practical method of generating a spin polarization. We then turn our attention to a magnetic field, where we recover Larmor precession, which cannot be obtained from a single-band point of view. In this case, the gradient energy correction can be regarded as due to a magnetic moment from the self-rotation of the wave packet, and we calculate its value for the light holes in the spherical four-band Luttinger model.},

This progress is summarized in a pedagogical manner in this review. A brief summary of necessary background is given and a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a variety of solid-state applications. A common thread of the review is the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and more general perturbations. Finally, a requantization method is demonstrated that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is clear that the Berry phase should be added as an essential ingredient to our understanding of basic material properties.},

	title = {Wilson loop approach to metastable topology of split elementary band representations and topological crystalline insulators with time reversal symmetry},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09719},
	abstract = {We present a general methodology towards the systematic characterization of crystalline topological insulating phases with time reversal symmetry (TRS). In particular, taking the two-dimensional spinful hexagonal lattice as a proof of principle we study windings of Wilson loop spectra over cuts in the Brillouin zone that are dictated by the underlying lattice symmetries. Our approach finds a prominent use in elucidating and quantifying the recently proposed "topological quantum chemistry" (TQC) concept. Namely, we prove that the split of an elementary band representation (EBR) by a band gap must lead to a topological phase. For this we first show that in addition to the Fu-Kane-Mele \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ classification, there is an obstructed \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\$-type classification protected by crystalline symmetries and TRS that accounts for all nontrivial Wilson loop windings of split EBRs. Then, by systematically embedding all combinatorial four-band phases into six-band phases, we find a refined topological feature of split EBRs. Namely, we show that while Wilson loop winding of split EBRs can unwind when embedded in higher-dimensional band space, two-band subspaces that remain separated by a band gap from the other bands conserve their Wilson loop winding, hence revealing a {\textbackslash}textit\{metastable\} topology of split EBRs. This clarifies the nature of "fragile topology" that has appeared very recently. We then argue that in the many-band limit the stable Wilson loop winding is only determined by the Fu-Kane-Mele \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ invariant implying that further stable topological phases must belong to the class of higher-order topological insulators.},

abstract="We show that in calculating the semiclassical energy levels of electrons in metals located in a magnetic field, one must determine whether or not the corresponding electron paths in the space of wave vectors k are attached to a band degeneracy line. Calculations in the two possible cases, i.e., with and without such attachment, differ by |e|ℏ/2m*c, where e is the electron charge and m* is the cyclotron mass of the electron. This shift in the energy levels is of a topological nature, and its existence depends neither on the specific form of the electron dispersion relation $\epsilon$(k) near the electron path nor on the shape or size of this path. The reason for this shift lies in the fact that the electron orbit is attached to the band degeneracy line, which is the line of singular points of the Bloch wave functions. In many respects this effect is similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect if the band degeneracy line is considered an infinitely thin ``solenoid.'' This shift in energy levels should become apparent in studies of oscillation phenomena in metals. We give examples of metals in which the conditions for observing the shift is probably the most favorable.",

	abstract = {We study a class of translational-invariant insulators with discrete rotational symmetry. These insulators have no spin-orbit coupling, and in some cases have no time-reversal symmetry either; i.e., the relevant symmetries are purely crystalline. Nevertheless, topological phases exist which are distinguished by their robust surface modes. Like many well-known topological phases, their band topology is unveiled by the crystalline analog of Berry phases, i.e., parallel transport across certain noncontractible loops in the Brillouin zone. We also identify certain topological phases without any robust surface modes; they are uniquely distinguished by parallel transport along bent loops, whose shapes are determined by the symmetry group. Our findings have experimental implications in cold-atom systems, where the crystalline Berry phase has been directly measured.},

We have observed a characteristic beating modulation in the amplitude of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in this system and up to six nodes have been measured in the Shubnikov-de Haas data for magnetic fields in the range 0.15 T{\textless}B{\textless}1.0 T. Analysis of these data indicates that one subband is primarily occupied and the two beating frequencies arise from a spin splitting of the lowest subband. A spin splitting of 1.5-2.5 meV as B→0 is deduced from the data. For magnetic fields applied at an angle θ to the interface, the beat positions scale as cosθ for small angles but increase steeply after a critical angle.},

Our experimental data and its analysis show that the band nonparabolicity effect cannot be neglected. For electron concentrations above 2×1012cm−2, it causes a reduction of α up to 25\%. We report the α value for the second subband.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the de Haas–van Alphen (dHvA) effect of a two-dimensional electron system in an AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction which exhibited structure inversion asymmetry. Using torque magnetometry at 30 mK the magnetic quantum oscillations are found to display beating patterns under large tilt angles. We attribute these features to spin splitting of the Fermi surface due to spin-orbit interaction. Such beating patterns in the dHvA effect have been predicted by Bychkov and Rashba more than two decades ago but have not been reported before. From the beat node positions in the magnetization M we estimate the zero-field spin splitting to be about 200 μeV. Interestingly we find characteristic phase changes in the dHvA signal accompanied by a shift of the discontinuous jump in M from the high-field to the low-field side of the dHvA oscillations. This observation is unexpected and needs further theoretical explanation.},
