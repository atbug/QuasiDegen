	abstract = {The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule lies at the heart of the semiclassical theory of a Bloch electron in a magnetic field. This rule is predictive of Landau levels and de Haas–van Alphen oscillations for conventional metals, as well as for a host of topological metals which have emerged in the recent intercourse between band theory, crystalline symmetries, and topology. The essential ingredients in any quantization rule are connection formulas that match the semiclassical ({WKB}) wave function across regions of strong quantum fluctuations. Here, we propose (a) a multicomponent {WKB} wave function that describes transport within degenerate-band subspaces, and (b) the requisite connection formulas for saddle points and type-{II} Dirac points, where tunneling respectively occurs within the same band, and between distinct bands. (a) and (b) extend previous works by incorporating phase corrections that are subleading in powers of the field; these corrections include the geometric Berry phase, and account for the orbital magnetic moment and the Zeeman coupling. A comprehensive symmetry analysis is performed for such phase corrections occurring in closed orbits, which is applicable to solids in any (magnetic) space group. We have further formulated a graph-theoretic description of semiclassical orbits. This allows us to systematize the construction of quantization rules for a large class of closed orbits (with or without tunneling), as well as to formulate the notion of a topological invariant in semiclassical magnetotransport—as a quantity that is invariant under continuous deformations of the graph. Landau levels in the presence of tunneling are generically quasirandom, i.e., disordered on the scale of nearest-neighbor level spacings but having longer-ranged correlations; we develop a perturbative theory to determine Landau levels in such quasirandom spectra.},
