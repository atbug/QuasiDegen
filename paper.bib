	abstract = {The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule lies at the heart of the semiclassical theory of a Bloch electron in a magnetic field. This rule is predictive of Landau levels and de Haas–van Alphen oscillations for conventional metals, as well as for a host of topological metals which have emerged in the recent intercourse between band theory, crystalline symmetries, and topology. The essential ingredients in any quantization rule are connection formulas that match the semiclassical (WKB) wave function across regions of strong quantum fluctuations. Here, we propose (a) a multicomponent WKB wave function that describes transport within degenerate-band subspaces, and (b) the requisite connection formulas for saddle points and type-II Dirac points, where tunneling respectively occurs within the same band, and between distinct bands. (a) and (b) extend previous works by incorporating phase corrections that are subleading in powers of the field; these corrections include the geometric Berry phase, and account for the orbital magnetic moment and the Zeeman coupling. A comprehensive symmetry analysis is performed for such phase corrections occurring in closed orbits, which is applicable to solids in any (magnetic) space group. We have further formulated a graph-theoretic description of semiclassical orbits. This allows us to systematize the construction of quantization rules for a large class of closed orbits (with or without tunneling), as well as to formulate the notion of a topological invariant in semiclassical magnetotransport—as a quantity that is invariant under continuous deformations of the graph. Landau levels in the presence of tunneling are generically quasirandom, i.e., disordered on the scale of nearest-neighbor level spacings but having longer-ranged correlations; we develop a perturbative theory to determine Landau levels in such quasirandom spectra.},

    Note = {$l^2S\gg 1$ is assured by requiring $\epsilon_0>0.4$; the reason of choosing $\epsilon_0<1.0$ is Dirac point lying at high energy requires too much harmonics in numerical diagonalization. This requirement is equivalent to $\sqrt{0.8m}\alpha/\hbar<Z<\sqrt{2m}\alpha/\hbar$, corresponding to the boundaries of the plots in (d).}

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

In some solids and for certain field orientations, λ/π are robustly integer valued, owing to the symmetry of the extremal orbit; i.e., they are the topological invariants of magnetotransport. Our comprehensive symmetry analysis identifies solids in any (magnetic) space group for which λ is a topological invariant, as well as the symmetry-enforced degeneracy of Landau levels. The analysis is simplified by our formulation of ten (and only ten) symmetry classes for closed, Fermi-surface orbits. Case studies are discussed for graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, 3D Weyl and Dirac metals, and crystalline and Z2 topological insulators. In particular, we point out that a π phase offset in the fundamental oscillation should not be viewed as a smoking gun for a 3D Dirac metal.},

Majorana and Weyl fermions had not been observed experimentally until the recent discovery of condensed matter systems such as topological superconductors and semimetals, in which they arise as low-energy excitations. Here we propose the existence of a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion that emerges at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter. This particle was missed by Weyl because it breaks the stringent Lorentz symmetry in high-energy physics. Lorentz invariance, however, is not present in condensed matter physics, and by generalizing the Dirac equation, we find the new type of Weyl fermion. In particular, whereas Weyl semimetals—materials hosting Weyl fermions—were previously thought to have standard Weyl points with a point-like Fermi surface (which we refer to as type-I), we discover a type-II Weyl point, which is still a protected crossing, but appears at the contact of electron and hole pockets in type-II Weyl semimetals. We predict that WTe2 is an example of a topological semimetal hosting the new particle as a low-energy excitation around such a type-II Weyl point. The existence of type-II Weyl points in WTe2 means that many of its physical properties are very different to those of standard Weyl semimetals with point-like Fermi surfaces.},

	abstract = {A generalized semiclassical quantization condition for cyclotron orbits was recently proposed by Gao and Niu {\textbackslash}cite\{Gao\}, that goes beyond the Onsager relation {\textbackslash}cite\{Onsager\}. In addition to the integrated density of states, it formally involves magnetic response functions of all orders in the magnetic field. In particular, up to second order, it requires the knowledge of the spontaneous magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility, as was early anticipated by Roth {\textbackslash}cite\{Roth\}. We study three applications of this relation focusing on two-dimensional electrons. First, we obtain magnetic response functions from Landau levels. Second we obtain Landau levels from response functions. Third we study magnetic oscillations in metals and propose a proper way to analyze Landau plots (i.e. the oscillation index \$n\$ as a function of the inverse magnetic field \$1/B\$) in order to extract quantities such as a zero-field phase-shift. Whereas the frequency of \$1/B\$-oscillations depends on the zero-field energy spectrum, the zero-field phase-shift depends on the geometry of the cell-periodic Bloch states via two contributions: the Berry phase and the average orbital magnetic moment on the Fermi surface. We also quantify deviations from linearity in Landau plots (i.e. aperiodic magnetic oscillations), as recently measured in surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators and emphasized by Wright and McKenzie {\textbackslash}cite\{Wright\}.},

	abstract = {We present a fresh perspective on the Landau level quantization rule; that is, by successively including zero-field magnetic response functions at zero temperature, such as zero-field magnetization and susceptibility, the Onsager’s rule can be corrected order by order. Such a perspective is further reinterpreted as a quantization of the semiclassical electron density in solids. Our theory not only reproduces Onsager’s rule at zeroth order and the Berry phase and magnetic moment correction at first order but also explains the nature of higher-order corrections in a universal way. In applications, those higher-order corrections are expected to curve the linear relation between the level index and the inverse of the magnetic field, as already observed in experiments. Our theory then provides a way to extract the correct value of Berry phase as well as the magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature from Landau level fan diagrams in experiments. Moreover, it can be used theoretically to calculate Landau levels up to second-order accuracy for realistic models.},

Applications to the experiments with bilayers in tilted magnetic fields in the metallic state are discussed. We speculate that AMRO may be also observed when each layer of the bilayer is in the composite-fermion state.},

	abstract = {Spatial symmetries in crystals may be distinguished by whether they preserve the spatial origin. Here we study spatial symmetries that translate the origin by a fraction of the lattice period, and find that these non-symmorphic symmetries protect an exotic surface fermion whose dispersion relation is shaped like an hourglass; surface bands connect one hourglass to the next in an unbreakable zigzag pattern. These ‘hourglass’ fermions are formed in the large-gap insulators, KHgX (X = As, Sb, Bi), which we propose as the first material class whose band topology relies on non-symmorphic symmetries. Besides the hourglass fermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a three-dimensional generalization of the quantum spin Hall effect, which has previously been observed only in two-dimensional crystals. To describe the bulk topology of non-symmorphic crystals, we propose a non-Abelian generalization of the geometric theory of polarization. Our non-trivial topology originates from an inversion of the rotational quantum numbers, which we propose as a criterion in the search for topological materials.},

@article{bradlyn_topological_2017,

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02050},
	abstract = {The past decade's apparent success in predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of topological insulators (TIs) and semimetals masks a fundamental shortcoming: out of 200,000 stoichiometric compounds extant in material databases, only several hundred of them - a set essentially of measure zero - are topologically nontrivial. Are TIs that esoteric, or does this reflect a fundamental problem with the current piecemeal approach to finding them? Two fundamental shortcomings of the current approach are: the focus on delocalized Bloch wavefunctions - rather than the local, chemical bonding in materials - and a classification scheme based on a collection of seemingly unrelated topological indices. To remedy these issues, we propose a new and complete electronic band theory that assembles the last missing piece - the link between topology and local chemical bonding - with the conventional band theory of electrons. Topological Quantum Chemistry is a description of the universal global properties of all possible band structures and materials comprised of a graph theoretical description of momentum space and a dual group theoretical description in real space. This patches together local \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{k\}{\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\$ dispersions into distinct global groups of energy bands: we classify all the possible bands for all 230 crystal symmetry groups involving \$s, p\$ or \$d\$ orbitals on any of the Wyckoff positions of every space group. We show how our topological band theory sheds new light on known TIs, and demonstrate the power of our method to predict a plethora of new TIs.},

	abstract = {We develop a formalism for treating coherent wave-packet dynamics of charge and spin carriers in degenerate and nearly degenerate bands. We consider the two-band case carefully in view of spintronics applications, where transitions between spin-split bands often occur even for relatively weak electromagnetic fields. We demonstrate that much of the semiclassical formalism developed for the single-band case can be generalized to multiple bands, and examine the nontrivial non-Abelian corrections arising from the additional degree of freedom. Along with the center of mass motion in crystal momentum and real space, one must also take into account the probability amplitudes to characterize the dynamics between the bands. We derive the wave packet energy up to the first order gradient correction and obtain the equations of motion for the real- and k-space center of the wave packet, as well as for the probability amplitudes. These equations include the non-Abelian Berry curvature terms and a non-Abelian correction to the group velocity. As an example, we apply our formalism to describe coherent wave packet evolution under the action of an electric field, demonstrating that it leads to electrical separation of spins. A sizable separation will be observed, with a large degree of tunability, making this mechanism a practical method of generating a spin polarization. We then turn our attention to a magnetic field, where we recover Larmor precession, which cannot be obtained from a single-band point of view. In this case, the gradient energy correction can be regarded as due to a magnetic moment from the self-rotation of the wave packet, and we calculate its value for the light holes in the spherical four-band Luttinger model.},

Over the past three decades it was gradually realized that the Berry phase of the electronic wave function can have a profound effect on material properties and is responsible for a spectrum of phenomena, such as polarization, orbital magnetism, various (quantum, anomalous, or spin) Hall effects, and quantum charge pumping. This progress is summarized in a pedagogical manner in this review. A brief summary of necessary background is given and a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a variety of solid-state applications. A common thread of the review is the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and more general perturbations. Finally, a requantization method is demonstrated that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is clear that the Berry phase should be added as an essential ingredient to our understanding of basic material properties.},
